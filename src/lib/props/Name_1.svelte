<script lang="ts">
  export let name: string = "default name"; // default value

<h5>The name is {name}</h5>
<!-- Just like $:, this may feel a little weird at 
    first. That's not how export normally works in 
    JavaScript modules! Just roll with it for now â€” 
    it'll soon become second nature. -->
